## **About the mod**

Pale garden has its own spooky vibe, making the silence of the biome quite unnerving. But what if I tell you, that there is another place somewhere in the world, that is just as serene but harmless?

Here grows the orchard of the blooming pale oak, where ghostly white leaves shed delicate petals. The ground is carpeted with fallen pale foliage, pale moss, and pale petals. Much like in the Pale Garden, no mobs spawn here, but music still plays.
